# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.

how it works
1. Express app instance is pointed to the project folder with .html, .css, and .js files.
2. An API key for OpenWeatherMap.com is created
3. A JavaScript Object named projectData initiated in the file server.js act as the app API endpoint.
4. Local server should be running and producing feedback to the Command Line through a working callback function.
